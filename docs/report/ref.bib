abstract = {This paper describes a method for animating suspended particle explosions. Rather than modeling the numerically troublesome, and largely invisible blast wave, the method uses a relatively stable incompressible fluid model to account for the motion of air and hot gases. The fluid's divergence field is adjusted directly to account for detonations and the generation and expansion of gaseous combustion products. Particles immersed in the fluid track the motion of particulate fuel and soot as they are advected by the fluid. Combustion is modeled using a simple but effective process governed by the particle and fluid systems. The method has enough flexibility to also approximate sprays of burning liquids. This paper includes several demonstrative examples showing air bursts, explosions near obstacles, confined explosions, and burning sprays. Because the method is based on components that allow large time integration steps, it only requires a few seconds of computation per frame for the examples shown.},

The algorithm enables large- and smallscale detail to be edited separately, allowing high-resolution detail to be added as a post-processing step. Instead of solving the Navier-Stokes equations over a highly refined mesh, we use the wavelet decomposition of a low-resolution simulation to determine the location and energy characteristics of missing high-frequency components. We then synthesize these missing components using a novel incompressible turbulence function, and provide a method to maintain the temporal coherence of the resulting structures. There is no linear system to solve, so the method parallelizes trivially and requires only a few auxiliary arrays. The method guarantees that the new frequencies will not interfere with existing frequencies, allowing animators to set up a low resolution simulation quickly and later add details without changing the overall fluid motion.},

Some previous methods model smoke or clouds as one fluid, but the volcanic clouds can not be treated as one fluid. The volcanic clouds consist of the pyroclasts, the volcanic gas and the entrained air. Since the pyroclasts and the volcanic gas can be treated as one fluid, called magma, the volcanic clouds are regarded as two fluids, the magma and the entrained air. The modeling in the 3D analysis space can be simplified to enhance the performance. Since our approach is physics motivated, it can be used to generate physically reasonable and realistic images of volcanic clouds from the volcanic initial eruption to the equilibrium situation.},

abstract = {Physics based simulation of the dynamics of water spray - water droplets dispersed in air - is a means to increase the visual plausi- bility of computer graphics modeled phenomena such as waterfalls, water jets and stormy seas. Spray phenomena are frequently en- countered by the visual effects industry and often challenge state of the art methods. Current spray simulation pipelines typically employ a combination of Lagrangian (particle) and Eulerian (volu- metric) methods - the Eulerian methods being used for parts of the spray where individual droplets are not apparent. However, exist- ing Eulerian methods in computer graphics are based on gas solvers that will for example exhibit hydrostatic equilibrium in certain sce- narios where the air is expected to rise and the water droplets fall. To overcome this problem, we propose to simulate spray in the Eu- lerian domain as a two-way coupled two-continua of air and water phases co-existing at each point in space. The fundamental equa- tions originate in applied physics and we present a number of con- tributions that make Eulerian two-continua spray simulation feasi- ble for computer graphics applications. The contributions include a Poisson equation that fits into the operator splitting methodology as well as (semi-)implicit discretizations of droplet diffusion and the drag force with improved stability properties. As shown by sev- eral examples, our approach allows us to more faithfully capture the dynamics of spray than previous Eulerian methods. CR},

@article{Foster1996,
abstract = {We present a comprehensive methodology for realistically animating liquid phenomena. Our ap- proach unifies existing computer graphics techniques for simulating fluids and extends them by incorporating more complex behavior. It is based on the Navier-Stokes equations which couple momentum and mass conservation to completely describe fluid motion. Our starting point is an environment containing an arbitrary distribution of fluid, and submerged or semi-submerged obsta- cles. Velocity and pressure are defined everywhere within this environment, and updated using a set of finite difference expressions. The resulting vector and scalar fields are used to drive a height field equation representing the liquid surface. The nature of the coupling between obstacles in the environment and free variables allows for the simulation of a wide range of effects that were not possible with previous computer-graphics fluid models. Wave effects such as reflection, refraction and diffraction, as well as rotational effects such as eddies, vorticity, and splashing are a natural consequence of solving the system. In addition, the Lagrange equations of motion are used to place buoyant dynamic objects into a scene, and track the position of spray and foamduring the animation process. Typical disadvantages to dynamic simulations such as poor scalability and lack of control are addressed by assuming that stationary obstacles align with grid cells during the finite difference discretization, and by appending terms to the Navier-Stokes equations to include forcing functions. Free surfaces in our system are represented as either a collection of massless particles in 2D, or a height field which is suitable for many of thewater rendering algorithms presented by researchers in recent years.},

In addition, clouds contain varying degrees of translucence, and their amorphous structure can change with time. Although several approaches to cloud simulation have produced impressive results, they have relied on complex mathematical models which produce high computation costs for a single image.This paper describes a new approach to cloud simulation using simple planar and curved surfaces whose surface shading and translucence are modulated by a mathematical texturing function. This approach represents the appearance of clouds with enough realism for a wide range of visual simulation but does so at a reasonable computational cost, allowing the generation of sequences of images on small minicomputers. In addition, the cloud model can be constructed in a straightforward manner.},

One of the most effective approaches for synthesizing realistic clouds is to simulate cloud formation processes based on the atmospheric fluid dynamics. Although this approach can create realistic clouds, the resulting shapes and motion depend on many simulation parameters and the initial status. Therefore, it is very difficult to adjust those parameters so that the clouds form the desired shapes. This paper addresses this problem and presents a method for controlling the simulation of cloud formation. In this paper, we focus on controlling cumuliform cloud formation. The user specifies the overall shape of the clouds. Then, our method automatically adjusts parameters during the simulation in order to generate clouds forming the specified shape. Our method can generate realistic clouds while their shapes closely match to the desired shape.},

A filtering method, inspired from Weber number thresholding, further controls the free marker generation (in a physics-based manner). Two separate models are used, one for sub-scale droplets, the other for sub-scale bubbles. Droplets are evolved in a Newtonian manner, using a density- extension drag force field, while bubbles are evolved using a model based on Stokes Law.We show that our model for sub-scale droplet and bubble dynamics is simple to couple with a full (macro-scale) Navier-Stokes two-phase flow model and is quite powerful in its applications.

Specifically, wet or dense snow that has both solid- and fluid-like properties is difficult to handle. Consequently, this pa- per presents a novel snow simulation method utilizing a user- controllable elasto-plastic constitutive model integrated with a hy- brid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method. The method is continuum based and its hybrid nature allows us to use a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. It also naturally allows us to derive a grid-based semi-implicit in- tegration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. We demonstrate the power of our method with a variety of snow phenomena including complex character in- teractions.},

abstract = {Realistically animated fluids can add substantial realism to interactive applications such as virtual surgery simulators or computer games. In this paper we propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate fluids with free surfaces. The method is an extension of the SPH-based technique by Desbrun to animate highly deformable bodies. We gear the method towards fluid simulation by deriving the force density fields directly from the Navier-Stokes equation and by adding a term to model surface tension effects. In contrast to Eulerian grid-based approaches, the particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable which reduces the complexity of the simulation. In addition, the particles can directly be used to render the surface of the fluid. We propose methods to track and visualize the free surface using point splatting and marching cubes-based surface reconstruction. Our animation method is fast enough to be used in interactive systems and to allow for user interaction with models consisting of up to 5000 particles.},
